As you know, many versions of Windows 11 don't support AtlasOS, and I've noticed that too, so I've modified an AtlasOS version to run on those versions. Please note that it may be unstable; This modified version is based on AtlasOS v0.5.0 =))
How to mod an AtlasOS version:
1. First, download an AtlasOS Playbook.
2. Extract it using 7-Zip, and the password for that Playbook version is "malte".
3. After extraction, you will have a file. Go into it and edit whatever you want.
4. After editing, compress all the files you JUST EDITED by going to 7-Zip and selecting "add to archive", choosing archive format as ZIP, and making sure to select Compression level as 0-Store. Then set Encryption method to ZipCrypto, set password as "malte", and then compress. After compression, change the file extension from .zip to .apbx.
Note: If you are using Windows 11 and you don't see the file extension, go to View -> Show -> File name extensions
